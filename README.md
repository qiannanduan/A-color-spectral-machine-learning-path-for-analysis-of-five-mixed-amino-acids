# A color-spectral machine learning path for analysis of five mixed amino acids

This repository is a data support for one of our recent studies. In this study, spectrum properties of mixed amino acids (AAs) samples were visualized as some color-spectral images (CSiMs). And then, the CSiMs and their corresponding concentration labels were built as three standardized datasets. We adopted six common convolutional neural networks: LeNet, Vanilla CNN, Residual Network (RestNet), SqueezeNet, VGGNet and GoogLeNet Inception v1 , to train on our dataset using transfer learning. The results showed that a well-trained model could predict multiple AAs at the same time, suggesting its value in facilitating quantitative analysis of mixed systems. To advance the research, we will fully demonstrate our progresses, and share our data sets including image sets and their labels.
