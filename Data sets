In the paper, we obtained three datasets from the mixed systems I-IV. These datasets were uploaded to four branches: 
(1) “5-dimensional AA (Hist-Arg-Phe-Alan-Thr) aqueous system”: image set (i.e., “image set.rar”) gathered from 3,600 5-dimensional AA samples, 
and their labels (i.e., "labels.xlsx”); 
(2) "5-dimensional AA (Pro-Gly-His-Thr-Phe) aqueous system": image set (i.e., “image set.rar”) gathered from 3,600 5-dimensional AA samples, 
and their labels (i.e., "labels.xlsx”);
(3) "5-dimensional AA (Pro-Gly-His-Thr-Phe) urine system": image set (i.e., “image set.rar”) gathered from 3,600 5-dimensional AA samples, 
and their labels (i.e., "labels.xlsx”).
